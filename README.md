## 📋 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive comparison of classical point cloud denoising algorithms, focusing on their performance in real-world applications. We evaluate four main categories of algorithms: Filter-based, Optimization-based, Graph-based, and Deep learning-based methods, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## 🚀 Features
- Implementation of multiple classical denoising algorithms:
  - Bilateral Filtering
  - Weighted Multi-projection (WMP)
  - Graph Laplacian Regularization (GLR)
  - Bipartite Graph Total Variation (BGTV)
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
- Support for both synthetic and real-world datasets
- Quantitative and qualitative analysis tools

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Open3D for point cloud processing
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib for visualization

## 📊 Results
Our experimental results demonstrate:
- Superior performance of Guided Filter and WMP on real-world data
- Consistent feature preservation with Bipartite Graph Denoising
- Optimal balance between smoothing and feature retention using Bilateral filtering

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Open3D
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🛠️ Setting Up the Environment
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install open3d numpy matplotlib
   ```

## 📥 Dataset Setup
1. Create directories for datasets:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/synthetic data/visibility_dataset
   ```

2. Download and extract the RG-PCD dataset:
   ```bash
   wget https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mmspg/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RG-PCD.zip
   unzip RG-PCD.zip -d data/synthetic
   ```

3. Download and extract the Visibility dataset:
   ```bash
   wget https://visibility.labri.fr/visibility_dataset.zip
   unzip visibility_dataset.zip -d data/visibility_dataset
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/point-cloud-denoising.git
   cd point-cloud-denoising
   ```

2. Run the evaluation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The project uses three main metrics for evaluation:
- Chamfer Distance (lower is better)
- Mean Squared Error (lower is better)
- Normal Consistency (higher is better)

## 🔍 Future Work
- Implementation of domain-specific solutions
- Integration with heritage preservation workflows
- Optimization for large-scale point clouds
- Development of adaptive parameter selection methods
